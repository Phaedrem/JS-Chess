## About This Project

This repository is based on a YouTube tutorial by [Ania Kub√≥w](https://youtu.be/Qv0fvm5B0EM) I followed to build a simple JavaScript chess game.  
Since the tutorial was made a few years ago, some of the functionality and APIs used in the video have since changed.  
Because of that, the project is currently a **work in progress** and does not behave exactly as it did in the tutorial.  

My goal is to update and adapt the code so it works with the current standards, while still keeping the original learning experience in mind.
